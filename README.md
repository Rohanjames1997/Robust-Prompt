# Robust-Prompt

Visual prompting has recently gained traction in its ability to transfer the learnings of a model on a particular distribution to another out-of-distribution dataset. Moreover, one of the best models evaluated on the ImageNet-C dataset, which aims at testing robustness of image classification, uses augmentation techniques such as  DeepAugment - an image-to-image neural network for performing data augmentation. In this work, we present a novel (to the best of our knowledge) technnique which combines visual prompting and DeepAugment to improve robustness of large language+vision models, specifically - CLIP. Apart from DeepAugment, we also perform composition with techninques like CutOut and CutMix and find that CutMix performs especially well on CIFAR-C, which serves as a measure for testing the model robustness to perturbations.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
To install the models run the `download_models.sh` file.

# Structure

* `/DeepAugment` contains scripts for evaluating deep augmented samples for ImageNet andn CIFAR-100.
* `/Evaluation` contains scripts for evaluating models on CIFAR-C dataset 
* `/ImageNetLoader` contains scripts for loading and manipulating ImageNet data
* `/model_checkpoints_version_1` contains checkpoints for our saved models
* `/VisualPrompting` contains scripts for training Visual prompts

# Data

# Data augmentation
### DeepAug:
### CutMix

```
python VisualPrompting/main_clip_cutmix.py 
```

### CutOut:
  To create the augmented images using cutout, run the following command:
  ```
  python cutout/create_and_save_data.py --dataset cifar100 --data_augmentation --cutout --length 16 --batch_size 1
  ```


# Visual Prompt Tuning

Once the dataset is created concatenated with the augmented data from CIFAR100, we run the prompt tuning stage to train the network to learn the parameters for the prompt. To tune the prompt for the CLiP model, run the following command:
```
python3 VisualPrompting/main_clip.py --dataset cifar100 --root ./data --train_folder [TRAIN_FOLDER_PATH_WITH_AUGMENTATIONS] --val_folder [VAL_FOLDER_PATHS_WITH_AUGMENTATIONS] --num_workers 1 --batch_size 64
```
